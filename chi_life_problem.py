#1 Import csv, numpy, and matplotlib.plot
#2 Open the chi_life_expectancy.txt file
#3 Use csv.reader(file, delimeter='\t') to read in the file to a list.  Make appropriate lists for plotting. Community name will be the x and 2010 life expectancy on the y.
#4 Plot the life_expectancy_2010_list vs a numpy arange() as a bar graph
#5 Use ax = plt.gca() to grab the axes object as ax. Use ax.set_xticklabels(community_list) to place the labels on the x axis, use the kwarg rotation=60 to tilt the lettering since there are a lot of communities
#6  Set an appropriate plt.ylim([min,max])
#7  Label your axes
#8  Add a title
#9  Add text to indicate the minimum and maximum values
#10 Customize your graph in at least two other ways using documentation from matplotlib.org
#11  Comment your code as always.

# Note:  If you would like to present something different than the above for your graph using this dataset, just let me know your intentions before you start and I will do my best to support you.
